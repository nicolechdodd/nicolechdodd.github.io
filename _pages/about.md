Hello! I am a fifth year PhD candidate in the [Department of Linguistics](https://linguistics.ucdavis.edu/) at the University of California, Davis. I am broadly interested in computational psycholinguistics, and study human language processing in natural (e.g., Arabic) and programming (e.g., Java) languages. I also study how humans interact with virtual assistants such as Amazon's Alexa.

I am advised by Dr. [Emily Morgan](https://sites.google.com/ucdavis.edu/eimorgan/) and currently manage the [Morgan Computational Psycholinguistics Lab](https://morganlab.ucdavis.edu/).
